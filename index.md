# Notes from Max Dei Rossi

Instructions:
* Add the files from this repo's src directory to your src directory
* From the src directory, run `python3 parse-musicxml.py [filename.musicxml]` with a musicxml file (ignore this step to use the demo)
* Run the main program (with `./run.sh main.cpp`)

Issues:
* Tie to a dotted note will ignore the dot
* Tempo markings do not affect all staves
* Does not support pickup measures
